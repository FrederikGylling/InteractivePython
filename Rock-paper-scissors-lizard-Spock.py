The mini-project is to build a the popular Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock game in Python

You are provided an template and plenty of great help in the course :)

## The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
## "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
## as follows:

## 0 - rock
## 1 - Spock
## 2 - paper
## 3 - lizard
## 4 - scissors

## helper functions
# it's great to first understand the problem and then divided into smaller tasks
# the problem is divided into one mainn funciton and 2 helper functions

import random

# helper funciton 1: converts input name to number based on above logic
def name_to_number(name):
    # delete the following pass statement and fill in your code below

        return 0
    elif name == "Spock":
        return 1
    elif name == "paper":
        return 2
    elif name == "lizard":
        return 3
    elif name == "scissors":
        return 4
